	  <h3>This is the bio of all those animals enlisted in collection page. The description is given order as that in the collection page hava a look.</h3>
	  <h4>1. Name: Asian Elephant</h4>
	  <h4>Scientific Name: Elephas maximus</h4>
	  <h4>Conservation Status:  Endangered (Population decreasing)</h4>
	  <h4>Life span: 48 years (Adult, In captivity, European population)</h4>
	  <h4>Trophic level: Herbivorous</h4>
	  <h4>Mass: Male: 5,400 kg (Adult), Female: 2,700 kg (Adult)</h4>
	  <h4>Height: Male: 2.7 m (Adult, At Shoulder), Female: 2.2 m (Adult, At Shoulder)</h4>
	  <h4>Places: Eastern Himalayas, Greater Mekong<h4>
	  <h4>Why they matter?</h4>
	  <p>A future for Asian elephants ensures a future for other species and wild spaces.</p>
	  <h4>Threats</h4>
	  <p>Even where suitable habitat exists, poaching remains a threat to elephants in many areas. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in ivory. However, there are still some thriving but unregulated domestic ivory markets in a number of countries which fuel an illegal international trade. Although most of this ivory comes from poaching of African elephants, Asian elephants are also illegally hunted for their ivory, as well as for their skin. In some countries, political unrest is disrupting antipoaching activities.</p>
	  <h4>2. Black Rhinoceros</h4>
	  <h4>Scientific Name :Diceros bicornis</h4>
	  <h4>Life span: 35 – 50 years</h4>
	  <h4>Mass: 800 – 1,400 kg (Adult)</h4>
	  <h4>Height: 1.3 – 1.8 m (Adult, At Shoulder)<h4>
	  <h4>Speed: 55 km/h (Maximum, Running)<h4>
	  <h4>Gestation Period: 15 – 16 months</h4>
	  <h4>Population: Fewer than 5,000</h4> 
	  <h4>Why they matter?</h4>
	  <p>Rhinos are one of the oldest groups of mammals, virtually living fossils. They play an important role in their habitats and in countries like Namibia, rhinos are an important source of income from ecotourism. The protection of black rhinos creates large blocks of land for conservation purposes. This benefits many other species, including elephants.</p>
	  <h4>Threats</h4>
	  <p>Black rhinos have two horns, and occasionally a third small posterior horn. The front horn is longer than the rear which makes them lucrative targets for the illegal trade in rhino horn. Between 1970 and 1992, 96 percent of Africa's remaining black rhinos were killed. A wave of poaching for rhino horn rippled through Kenya and Tanzania, continued south through Zambia's Luangwa Valley as far as the Zambezi River, and spread into Zimbabwe. Political instability and wars have greatly hampered rhino conservation work in Africa, notably in Angola, Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan. This situation has exacerbated threats such as trade in rhino horn, and increased poaching due to poverty.Today, black rhinos remain Critically Endangered because of rising demand for rhino horn, which has driven poaching to record levels. A recent increase in poaching in South Africa threatens to erase our conservation success. The increase is driven by a growing demand from some Asian consumers, particularly in Vietnam, for folk remedies containing rhino horn. AIn 2014, a total of 1,215 rhinos were poached in South Africa – a 21 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
	  <h4>3. Name: Borneo_elephant</h4>
	  <h4>Scientific Name: Elephas maximus borneensis</h4>
	  <h4>Class: Mammalia</h4>
	  <h4>Higher classification: Asian elephant</h4>
	  <h4>Subspecies: E. m. borneensis</h4>
	  <h4>Height: 8.2 - 9.8 feet </h4>
	  <h4>Population: Approximately 1,500 </h4>
	  <h4>Why they matter?</h4>
	  <p>Borneo’s elephants are a high conservation priority, yet they remain the least-understood elephants in the world.</p>
	  <h4>Threats</h4>
	  <p>Shrinking forests bring the elephants into more frequent contact with people, increasing human -elephant conflict in the region. New oil palm plantations in the area mean more human settlements, with some people setting illegal snares to catch small game. In the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, it is estimated that 20 percent of resident elephants have sustained injuries from these snares.</p>
	  <h4>4. Name: Cottontop Tamarin</h4>
	  <h4>Scientific Name: Saguinus oedipus</h4>
	  <h4>Conservation Status: Endangered</h4>
	  <h4>Rank: Species</h4>
	  <h4>Higher classification: Tamarin</h4>
	  <h4>Height: Wild males and females weigh between 410 and 450 g (14.5 and 15.9 oz) but average 416.5 g (14.7 oz)</h4>
	  <h4>Why they matter?</h4>
	  <p>The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) is a Critically Endangered primate species, endemic to northwest Colombia, threatened by deforestation and illegal trade. In order to assess the current state of this species, we analyzed changes in the population of cotton-top tamarins and its habitat from 2005 to 2012.</p>
	  <h4>Threats</h4>
	  <h4>5. Name: Red Wolf</h4>
	  <h4>Scientific Name: Canis rufus</h4>
	  <h4>Conservation Status: Endangered</h4>
	  <h4>Life span: 5-6 years, and as long as 14 years in captivity.</h4>
	  <h4>Mass: 45-80 pounds</h4>
	  <h4>Height:  4 feet long and stand about 26 inches at the shoulder</h4>
